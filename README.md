# Personalized Meal Plan Generator_Palanichamy Naveen

## Introduction
In this project, we build a recommendation system to suggest personalized meal plans based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and nutritional goals. This helps individuals find suitable meals that meet their dietary needs and health goals.

## Dataset
We use a synthetic dataset that includes various meals, their dietary preferences, and nutritional information such as calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

## Steps

1. **Creating the Dataset**: We create a synthetic dataset of healthy meals.
2. **Building the Recommendation System**: We build a recommendation system using content-based filtering.
3. **Visualizing the Recommendations**: We visualize the recommended meals using a bar chart.

## Conclusion
We successfully built a personalized meal plan generator that provides meal recommendations based on dietary preferences and nutritional goals. This system helps individuals maintain a healthy diet tailored to their specific needs. Future improvements could include using a real dataset, incorporating more dietary preferences, and adding more detailed nutritional information.
